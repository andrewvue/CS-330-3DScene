# CS-330-3DScene
How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? 

How I approach designing software is looking at the main objective of the project and create a wireframe/pseudo code of the project. The new design skills that my work on the project is essentially everything to do with 3D graphics. Before this course I haven't had any experience coding 3D assets and I had no experience working with OpenGL. In the past I have played around with 3D art like Blendr, but not actually coding assets.

What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? How do I approach developing programs? 

The process I followed were to follow the course modules in creating each step of the 3D scene from rendering the object, camera, texture, and lighting. I approache developing programs in a step by step manner, by breaking down a large project or objective into smaller parts and tackling each at a time.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? 

Development strategies I used while working on my 3D scene was to incorporate libraries and existing formulas into my code instead of trying to create new code from scratch.

How did iteration factor into your development? How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I think the iteration factor of each step helped me understand the concepts to a certain degree and allowed me to better visualize my project. Though, it took me a lot of time to understand certain concepts. I think breaking down the project into smaller pieces helped with my sense of progression.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

My goal is to be a professional software developer focusing on fullstack web development and mobile development so computer science is an integral part of this.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 

I think computational graphics and visualizations have given me a betterr appreciation for graphics and game engines created by other engineers. If I were to get into this field I will definitely need more time to dedicate to learning these skills and concepts.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computational graphics and visualizations have given me knowledge of how to work with existing libraries, formulas and code. It has also helped me understand graphics, color, and space. This will help me greatly in my professional aspirations of being a Full-Stack Web Developer and Mobile Developer.
